# Canvas-Rotozoomer
https://articzera.github.io/Canvas-Rotozoomer/
A simple rotozoomer made in javascript using Canvas. A interesting thing is that you can choose the settings you want, for your rotozoomer, like the speed, zoom, saturation, color, pattern and rotation.

I also leaved some bonus effects that I made and I like it.

# About this
Everything here was made less than 1 day. The code isn't too good and it could be more optimized and efficient I know. However, I really liked the results of this project, since I am begginer on Javascript. This have inspired me a lot.
